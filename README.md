# What is Extended?

Originally, YouTube Vanced was an application that allowed you to have the features of YouTube Premium for free, in including an ad blocker, Picture in Picture, and adding features such as Sponsorblock and, for the last update, Return YouTube Dislikes (RYD)
But March 13, 2022 was an unfortunate date, Team Vanced announced the end of YouTube Vanced support due to a letter from Google.
For several weeks many users wondered how they would continue to enjoy its useful features, they added a few minutes later that the application would work for another 2 years before becoming obsolete about
(Which is still working now, but the integrated ad blocker is not working properly anymore)

A few days later (March 21, 2022), in the shadow, ReVanced work hard to have the same functionality as YouTube Vanced, the only difference is that you have to patch the application yourself,
That's why Google sent a cease and desist letter to Vanced: it's legal to modify an application for personal use, but illegal to share this modified application, that's the mistake Team Vanced made
This is the ingenuity of its spiritual successor ReVanced, rather than proposing the modified version of YouTube directly in free download, not only, they remain legal, but in addition, one has a control of the patches to apply.
(I agree, it is contradictory with what this fork proposes, but in these cases, it is me who may have problems, not them)

After a lot of hard work in the last months, on June 5, 2022, the first version of ReVanced is available.

Later, ReVanced proposes to patch directly YouTube Vanced to update the adblocker list
And also offer YouTube Music.

In addition to creating patches for YouTube, YT Music and Vanced, ReVanced diversifies by offering patches for other applications.

But as i write this, there have been a lot of updates to YouTube, a lot of features have been added, which makes Vanced contain more and more bugs, from time to time, some users complain that Vanced doesn't work anymore because the application asks to be updated or the ads are not blocked anymore.
This makes Vanced not safe to use anymore (Security problems, update problems, missing features).

Unfortunately, ReVanced is not as popular as its predecessor Vanced, but I would like it to be one day. (but not too much either to avoid Google banning their activities)
I think the popularity of ReVanced is affected by the fact that the application is not available directly patched.
That's also why I created this fork, to allow more people to discover ReVanced without having to patch the application, so that it is ready to use.
ReVanced updates are not regular, but are stable.

I thank Team Vanced for creating YouTube Vanced and I also thank Team ReVanced for resurrecting Vanced, and for allowing us to use YouTube with more features.
